## Project Objective: 
The aim of this project is to develop a Employee Management Spring Boot application which utilises advanced methodologies and technologies for the persistence of data in any field to a remote database for subsequent query when necessary.
The software is written in Java language and has the capacity for the Employers to store, update, retrieve and delete data on different "employers" on a local database. It is integrated with an API which allows online access to this database through series of HTTP requests from a tool called Postman. 
The ability to integrate and store data remotely is fast becoming a must in the present world. Hence, a backend software which can achieve this is quite laudable. In this project, Java programming language (with Spring Boot) has been used due to its versatility and easy of compilation on different computer architectures.
